                            <p>Julian Richings was born in Oxford, England, and has become a familiar figure to Canadian cinema and television audiences, appearing in over 50 films and 20 separate television series. So I heard that there was a Xash3D port of garry's mod for android, and I have Xash3D as well as Half-life on my phone, but I can't seem to find a download for this Xash3D port of garry's mod (or at least, not any REAL downloads.) Now I know what you're thinking, "wouldn't it just be easier to install tiber's box 2 on your pho-" No. That game sucks compared to all the gameplay I saw of this Xash3D port. Any help? Please. 
Second Life is a free to play online life simulation game that will appeal to fans of the virtual world genre. The game is developed by Linden Lab and has been online since ~~GPU is a 1080 Strix Advanced on an Arctic Accelero IV cooler. The cooler is massive, one slot above the card and two below (plus the one it sits in, so 4 total). Noise levels are great and after making a fan curve, overclocked thermals are no worry at all. Its been installed properly (not normally compatible), fan control is connected directly to the GPU, and I may 3d print some even sturdier brackets for the longer side. If requested, I'll include the original (damaged) heatsink, LED backplat.

Zero speculation here, just cold, hard facts. If I've missed anything by any chance please let me know and I'll add it.

The supreme function of statesmanship is to provide against preventable evils. In seeking to do so, it encounters obstacles which are deeply rooted in human nature. One is that by the very order of things such evils are not demonstrable until they have occurred: at each stage in their onset there is room for doubt and for dispute whether they be real or imaginary. By the same token, they attract little attention in comparison with current troubles, which are both indisputable and pressing:. Rejoice all! For enaisiaion has been making a new mod. For all of you who dont know he has been posting constent updates on his pareon at: https://www.patreon.com/EnaiSiaion/posts Infront of you is a list of every full deity (there were a bunch of ones listed at much earlier times and appear to be incomplete - see actual patreon page to see what I mean) That has been announced by enai thus far, I will make sure this list stays updated as to create a masterlist. Please If you want to skip the backstory and go right to the main question, go to paragraph 2 I have been replaying Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim for a few weeks now. I got bored of the character which I was playing in Skyrim and decided to make a new character. I am using an alternate start mod and decided to be an Orc and to focus my play style to basically being the baddest motherfucker on the planet and kill anything and everything with a big war axe and some heavy Orcish armor. As it stands, there has been much confusion and head-scratching surrounding the obscure text written by MK in 2012, “The Magne-Ge Pantheon”. As a long-time lurker and first-time contributor, I wanted to offer some theories regarding the contents of the document and what they could mean for our understanding of the Elder Scrolls cosmos. While I have not completely decoded the piece (I don’t think any single scholar could, or if it has been done, then they are officially smarter Croatoan, Earth : Church of Echoes : Part 139 ---------- ----- :: Prospecting Fields of the Feck Alliance :: Meshuweck Empire :: Tiber Star Cluster :: ---- He watched the scope with tired eyes, pleading with it to tell him something new, to show him something he didn't know. It'd been two months since the Hammerfell. That was two months spent hunting down the ships that'd chased off Wheatley and the others, the three Thaumaturge and the last remaining prison guard. UPDATE: Since this has gotten way bigger than I expected, I need admins to help me. The teams are going to be divided into regiments and I need an admiral for every regiment.

Again the hour grew late and Greatpapa closed the story for the evening. I had been giving him my full attention, completely engrossed in the tale, and refused to let him end there. I tried to get him to continue, but he declined. The day had been long and would be longer come morning. I protested and grew angry with him. I was weary and temperamental as only a small child can be. Needless to say, my Greatpapa had little tolerance for my imputence, and he threw me from his tent. 
Croatoan, Earth : Church of Echoes : Part 68 ----- ----- :: Hammerfell :: Nexus Prison Ship for Specials :: Tiber Star Cluster :: Unexplored Space :: ---- "Stop. Stop, stop, stop!" "What?" Wheatley asked, trying again to squeeze past the others. "Stop," Issidil rasped again. "Just move back and slid right." "You slide back and let Jotham slide in," Issy fired back in a shouted whisper. "Jotham's an idiot. He's too inept to do the job. It takes someone with skill and familiarity. gtThere is a branch of offensive magic that strikes directly at the soul. It is not hindered by abjurations of any kind, whether physical or pure aether. It is almost invariably fatal, and leaves behind no material for the mechanisms of the Dreamsleeve to work upon, nor any shred for the marketplace of Oblivion to bargain over. It is not a costly nor a taxing magic to cast, and it is operable by any caster with the slightest experience, on any target with any shade of soul. The most that could. This is the second story I wrote of these attempts to make insane Daedric cultists relatable and coherent. This one deals with Vaermina and I had to go a bit further than I did with Boethiah in regards to making up my own lore stuff.but I think it works out fine. Also, it is, of course, just the ideations of one (possibly completely deranged) cultist. So I wasn't too worried about staying within the lines of accepted Daedric theory.anyways.

Journal of Jaedien Balmath 29th of Sun's Height – 193 Today is my 12th birthday! My Ma decided it was about time I started writing down my life since I'm nearly a grown up and she didn't teach me for nothing. I'm not so sure; I think all this writing things down business is for girls, but Ma tells me I'm sure to have adventures that will need writing down “for posterity,” whatever that means. I wish Pa was here to give me a great big sword or a real helmet, but I know he's out there seeing. The Argonian Account, Book One by Waughin Jarth On a minor but respectable plaza in the Imperial City sat, or perhaps lounged, Lord Vanech's Building Commission. It was an unimaginative, austere building not noted so much for its aesthetic or architectural design as for its prodigious length. If any critics wondered why such an unornamented, extended erection held such fascination for Lord Vanech, they kept it to themselves.

Master Raven bids me to share with you in the 4th Era, the history of our illustrious order/er/er/er. First, a bit of background of myself. I have been in operation for over 1,000 years, with many, many years of responsibility to the Ruby Throne and its masters. Many more under the care and maintenance of the Mythic Dawn.

MK's Original work ( is written in a way that makes it hard to figure out what's going on. Repeated readings certainly helps that out, but some people just don't enjoy the puzzlework. This is for them. A few notes and links to related things for context. Only a few. -- In the Past -- Duadeen wondered if the pirate could give any kind of version at all now. Every time the Emperor shouted, things Okay, lately I've been thinking a lot about horsemanship in Tamriel, and I thought r/teslore might be interested in some of my musings and conclusions. I will just say that the title is something of an exaggeration, I'm just a sucker for alliteration. The first conclusion I have come to is that horsemanship (that is, the domestication and riding of horses) is an almost exclusively human tradition: - Horses would be worse than useless in Black Marsh (few mammals can live there, and Argonians. OOC: Go read this (https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/5cz673/in_which_eric_secures_a_retirement_plan/) if you haven't. ------ There was a thud, a sharp pain as his body hit the concrete-like water. His head heard the most, being the first thing that went in. It it didn't kill him, a lack of air would. He wanted to recite that old prophecy, and he felt like he could in many voices, like a choir singing a song. Then he felt himself suffocate briefly, before it all went blank. I posted about this a few months back and never finished it, but it's finally ready to test. In the spirit of my Bards only play on request mod, I've been making small changes to behaviors that drove me crazy after so much time in the game. Whiterun is a beautiful place, especially with expansion / tree mods, and Heimskr's incessant yelling just made it unpleasant. Now, he only preaches from 8am-12pm on Sundas morning. The rest of the time he is either wandering around Whiterun, praying. I am new to Skyrim, new to these sort of games in general. I got a tip form a friend that said, they are way more fun if you roleplay them as I was finding it a little drab. I started coming up with characters, back stories and am having a blast, it really made Skyrim fun for me and can understand why people rack so many hours up now. That said I have a question, being new I could be simply missing the lore or skipped over it, but. How is it possible to roleplay certain races with the whole. by Shay Ogre-Wrath, Lord of the Sweetroll Valleys Ah, whadda y'know? I knew you'd end up opening the cover of this book; you're nothing if not predictable. Was it the gold lettering that caught your eye? No, no, let me guess again. It was the opportunity to learn from the great Shay Ogre-Wrath, Lord of the Sweetroll Valleys, wasn't it? Haha, I knew I'd get it! Wait, that wasn't it? Well spill the beans then, maggot; why did you open this book? You wanted to touch the red leather of a Flesh.
