Hi everyone, I have a large investment in VMWare workstation. Lots of images and workflow that depends on them. On more and more projects Docker creeps in though. Unfortunately my development platform is on Windows, and as far as I can understand the installation of Docker on Windows requires the use of Hypervisor from Windows, which appears disable WMWorkstation from running. Have anyone else encountered this and if so how did you solve it? I would VMware Workstation 10 for Linux: VMware Workstation 10.0.6 for Linux: 2015-05-05: Go to Downloads Enter a valid date. en_US.

Hey! After a certain system, starting with "w", completely messed up my system again, I decided I to switch to linux. As a beginner, I decided to go with a more beginner friendly system, like uehm arch linux. The wiki of arch is really well written and totally easy to understand as beginner, so installing and optimizing the system was cake and did not take long at all. All in all it turned out pretty well, and for games, I even get a few more fps more on my system now. I uploaded a complete.

I recently was lucky enough to become IT Manager at an VFX School, unfortunately, most of my knowledge lies in helping the students with vfx related software etc, and not actual system management. :( I am however doing my best to wrap my head around everything, i however really need help with system deployment. Background/Environment: We have about 125 computers, with about 6 different hardware configs. I was taugh. VMware Workstation Pro and VMware Workstation Player are the industry standard for running multiple operating systems as virtual machines on a single. 
How much do you know about GNU/Linux? (Not much / About average / A lot) About Average. I've installed a lot of distros and consider myself a hopper. I've installed Arch but haven't tried yet LFS or Gentoo. Do you prefer the Windows or MacOS design? (Or if you know what a Desktop Environment is, list your favourite) (Windows / Mac OS) I don't really care. I don't really want to work with tiling WM, but I don't have a prefered DE/WM. Is your hardware fairly old or obscure, or is it modern. VMware Workstation is a hosted hypervisor that runs on x64 versions of Windows and Linux operating systems (an x86 version of earlier releases was available); it enables users to set up virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine, and use them simultaneously along with the actual machine. gt How much do you know about GNU/Linux? (Not much / About average / A lot) Average. Comfortable enough to setup Arch but not comfortable enough to fix it when shit hits the fan. gt Do you prefer the Windows or MacOS design? (Or if you know what a Desktop Environment is, list your favourite) (Windows / Mac OS) I may install tiling wm on top of a DE. Some basic features like folder viewer, network managers are nice but I like tiling wm on laptop. Is your hardware fairly old or obscure

So if you have ever imagined being able to operate three or four computer systems I've been using Ubuntu for a few years now, and am comfortable with very simple commands(e.g. `ls`, `mv`, etc). I think i've spent enough time with Unity and want to try something else. is there another distro that is lighter than Ubuntu but is stable enough for most things? iirc there was some bug with gnome/Ubuntu 16.04 so i was thinking of getting a completely new distro instead of just changing the WM Do you prefer the Windows or MacOS design?

Some time ago, when I was trying to set up my workstation I created a ".xprofile" script to get around some issues regarding screen resolution and multiple monitors, due to xrandr commands not saving on system restart.
